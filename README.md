This is the biggest project I have ever done, and though I haven't finished it, I have given it my best effort. However, due to my limited knowledge and time, I couldn't complete it as planned. You might think I would be disappointed, but no, it has gone more than my expectations. I came up with the idea of creating a roulette game, thinking it would be simple just making it spin and logging the value. However it turned out to be more complicated than I initially thought.

The code I've written reflects what I've gained through research and learning. As a transfer student, starting this code required dealing with unfamiliar concepts such as classes and working on multiple files, which I had no prior experience with. During the testing phase, errors emerged that I had never encountered before. I felt scared and almost cried because the due date was approaching, and I had to rework it under time pressure.

I had taken a similar course at my previous college. When I arrived at Temple and found myself assigned to the same course again, I thought it might be somewhat boring due to repetition. However, I was really surprised by what I learned throughout the semester, ranging from the simplest concepts like turtle graphics to creating a pig game.

I'm not expecting an A grade because I haven't completed what I had planned. Nevertheless, most importantly, I have acquired valuable knowledge and skills essential for my future career, including time management. I worked independently on this project, and I'm genuinely proud of what I have achieved through this experience.
